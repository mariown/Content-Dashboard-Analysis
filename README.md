# Content Dashboard Analysis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of various content types and reactions, visualized through a custom-built dashboard. The data provides insights into how different types of content are received based on various reaction types, sentiment scores, and categories.

## Project Background
This project was developed as part of the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage. The simulation provided a dataset containing user reactions to different content types, and the objective was to analyze and visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.

## Data Source
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Content ID**: Unique identifier for each content.
- **Reaction Type**: The type of reaction given by users (e.g., love, hate, scared).
- **Datetime**: The date and time when the reaction was recorded.
- **Content Type**: The type of content (e.g., photo, video).
- **Category**: The category of content (e.g., studying, technology).
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment of the reaction (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Score**: A numerical score associated with the reaction.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze the distribution of content types and their associated reactions.
2. To identify sentiment patterns across different content categories.
3. To visualize the trends in content uploads over time.

## Key Insights
- The dashboard reveals the percentage distribution of content types and their associated sentiment scores.
- The sentiment analysis shows the prevalence of positive, neutral, and negative reactions across different categories.
- Monthly trends in content uploads highlight peaks and troughs in content production and reaction engagement.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Looker Studio**: For dashboard creation and data visualization.
